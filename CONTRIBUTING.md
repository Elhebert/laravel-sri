# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**. We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/Elhebert/laravel-sri).

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request:

- Make sure to write tests!
- Document any change in behaviour. Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- One pull request per feature. If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- Send coherent history. Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
